This way:
- On GitHub, your name will appear nicely at the bottom.
- You can link to your GitHub profile or email.
- You can even add a profile picture using Markdown if you want.

If you‚Äôd like, I can **rewrite your whole README** from start to finish with:
- Project title
- Description
- Setup steps (these commands)
- Author section with your name and GitHub link  
and make it look professional.  

Do you want me to create that polished full README now?
